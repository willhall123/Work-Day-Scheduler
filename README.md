# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Website Overveiw
### This app is a daily planner to create a schedule for a person with a busy life. When you open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When you scroll down, you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm). When you view the timeblocks for that day, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Click into a timeblock and enter an event. When you click the save button for that timeblock, the text for that event is saved in local storage. When you refresh the page, the saved events persist.
